license-generator
=================
The ``license-generator`` is a simple CLI tool which allow you to create LICENSE files in a single command.
The tool ships with the most common types of licenses used in the software industry. The list of available
licenses can be found in the ``license_generator/licenses/`` folder.

The package is undergoing development so you **may** find bugs. The only command currently available is ``generate``,
which, as you might guess, will generate the license you will specify.
Example: ::

    $ license-generator generate MIT
